Key Features & Flexbox Implementation 


Horizontal Navigation: Created a responsive nav bar using display: flex with items aligned via justify-content and align-items.


Content Cards: Added multiple cards aligned in rows using Flexbox.


Responsiveness: Implemented flex-wrap to ensure that content moves to the next line on smaller screens, maintaining a clean mobile layout.

w does Flexbox help responsiveness? It eliminates the need for complex float calculations or fixed widths, allowing components to adapt fluidly to different device screen sizes.
