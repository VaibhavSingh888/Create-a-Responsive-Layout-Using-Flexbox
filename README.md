Debugging: Browser DevTools 

Key Features & Flexbox Implementation 


Horizontal Navigation: Created a responsive nav bar using display: flex with items aligned via justify-content and align-items.


Content Cards: Added multiple cards aligned in rows using Flexbox.


Responsiveness: Implemented flex-wrap to ensure that content moves to the next line on smaller screens, maintaining a clean mobile layout.


Dynamic Alignment: Used flex-direction to stack elements vertically on mobile viewports.

Interview Questions & Insights 


What is Flexbox?  It is a layout model that allows elements within a container to automatically adjust their width, height, and order to best fill available space.


Difference between Flexbox and Grid?  Flexbox is one-dimensional (handles either a row or a column), while Grid is two-dimensional (handles both rows and columns at once).


What does justify-content do?  It aligns flex items along the main axis of the container (e.g., centering items horizontally).


When would you use flex-wrap? I use flex-wrap when I want to prevent items from shrinking too much or overflowing by allowing them to drop to a new line on smaller screens.


How does Flexbox help responsiveness? It eliminates the need for complex float calculations or fixed widths, allowing components to adapt fluidly to different device screen sizes.
